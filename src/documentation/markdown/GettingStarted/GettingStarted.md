# Getting Started

## Overview

Our Buffer Design System documentation is broken down into a few core sections:

## Patterns

Patterns help to define common collections of components or interface elements, like layouts, navigation or product sidebars which may be comprised of many smaller components.

[Patterns](Patterns/navigation)

## Guides

Our guides provide the thinking and context for our design system. These will help us extend and design new components and patterns we've yet to build while ensuring a consistent experience.
