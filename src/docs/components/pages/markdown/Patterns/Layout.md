# Layout
##Overview
Our overall layout is used to create high level consistency across our products and is comprised of three main elements: navigation, sidebar and content areas. 

Content areas in particular will change the most the most from product to product, adapting to fit the unique needs of a given view (more below). 

Though our products are built internally by separate teams, our end goal is for our customers to feel as if they're moving seamlessly between sections of a single product or experience – not jumping between products.

## Wide Content Area
A wide content area is best suited for experiences that need more screen space for a given task or UI. For example, charts or graphs (like those in Analyze), inboxes (like those in Reply) or full-screen publishing calendars (like those in Publish) are great examples where a wide content area makes sense.

## Normal Content Area
A normal content area is best suited for experiences which are content heavy or contain a lot of text. For example feeds or lists comprised of social media posts. The width of a normal content area has been designed for optimal readability with room for up 75 characters per line.

## Narrow Content Area
A narrow content area is best suited for single task UI like settings or configuration.
