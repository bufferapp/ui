# Principles

## Be clear, not clever
We choose to be clear, not clever in our solutions, interactions and patterns. Clear and obvious is better than clever and nuanced for our customers. 

## Be friendly and helpful
We avoid jargon and technical words in favor of friendly human centered language. We choose simpler words and assume a beginners mind.  

## Be inclusive and mindful
We design for a diverse set of customers, that speak many languages, from different cultural backgrounds. We're mindful to design solutions that are accessible to all, including those with different abilities than our own.
