Combined with simple modifiers, they can be changed in size and appearance.\\n\\n![Buttons](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LG1azvO7JIiKQ1f0uKw%2F-LG1b2FYuWGP23onJBFW%2Fbutton-dimensions%402x.png?alt=media&token=fa07197f-730e-43f6-8a19-ad8214226bb1)\\n\\n## Primary Button\\nPrimary buttons are a clear call to action. When a single action can be prioritized, such as saving changes, adding an item to a queue or sending a message, a primary button should be used.\\n\\n![Primary Button](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LG2YWwFrp2F0ixlx1H6%2F-LG2YeFCQABTYMm_VwQP%2Fprimary-buttons%402x.png?alt=media&token=364a10d8-939a-4447-ba02-24b7e9afde4a)\\n\\n<InfoCard title='Do:' color='green'>\\n- Use only one primary button in a given card or section.\\n</InfoCard>\\n\\n\\n<InfoCard title='Do not:' color='red'>\\n- Don't use a primary button unless there's a clear default action to take. Instead, use multiple secondary buttons.\\n</InfoCard>\\n\\n\\n## Secondary Button\\nSecondary buttons are the most common and widely used. When multiple actions can be taken by the user, secondary buttons should be used over multiple primary buttons.\\n\\n![Secondary Button](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LG2YWwFrp2F0ixlx1H6%2F-LG2ZZEC0CzodyAh6yRm%2Fsecondary-buttons%402x.png?alt=media&token=420e9f11-f9b2-4ba9-be42-eefcc2dae559)\\n\\n## Text Button\\nText buttons are most often used for secondary actions that don't require the emphasis of a secondary button. For example, you may place a text button with a \\\"Cancel\\\" label adjacent to a primary button in a modal:\\n\\n![Text Button](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LG1ZpIPkZJGPdAGaomm%2F-LG1_DQzTLYFgMlj29pr%2Ftext-button-example.png?alt=media&token=5dafb056-cd2e-4044-9814-82d0b368194b)\\n\\nText buttons follow the same core principles as other buttons including height and horizontal padding dimensions ensuring a consistent click or tap surface area:\\n\\n![Text Button States](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LG2YWwFrp2F0ixlx1H6%2F-LG2Zdw1NP2HNHSKDCfS%2Ftext-buttons%402x.png?alt=media&token=f5c23651-561d-4862-bf07-b06e391097c5)\\n\\n\\n## Split Button\\n\\nSplit buttons provide a default primary action with additional options if needed.\\n\\n![Split Button](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LG1ZpIPkZJGPdAGaomm%2F-LG1_MXIk4YnFwvlaOTi%2Fsplit-buttons%402x.png?alt=media&token=26b99ca6-7c87-49f8-8ada-09bcedf71af0)\\n\\n![Buttons](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LFyEalgNvHBhbZCH1g1%2F-LFyGeJp-Gq78XdKBf9o%2Fsplit-button-dimensions%402x.png?alt=media&token=489f7bef-4d5f-426b-bd62-317123c15fef)\\n\\n\\n<InfoCard title='Do:' color='green'>\\n\\n- Use split buttons to simplify 3 or more actions, including one primary action and multiple secondary actions.\\n\\n</InfoCard>\\n\\n\\n<InfoCard title='Do not:' color='red'>\\n\\n- Use a split button when only one secondary action is available.

This means that by and large, component dimensions, spacing between components, and padding within components will be divisible by 8 pixels (and no less than 8 pixels). \\n\\nNote: There are a few notable exceptions to this rule – see below. \\n\\n## Common dimensions\\nComponent dimensions and spacing between components will generally use one of these common values (all multiples of 8):\\n\\n```\\n8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 40px, 48px, 56px, 64px, etc\\n```\\n\\n## Exceptions\\n\\n### Sub-component padding and margins\\n\\nThere are a few instances in which the sub-component elements' padding and margins will not fall on an 8px grid. \\n\\nButtons are a specific example of this in which the vertical padding of the button label does not fall on the grid – instead the label is vertically centered within the button component itself:\\n\\n![Grids](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LJyUTfgi9aZnPg370Hj%2F-LJyhLr2SrLz94trBf7O%2Fgrid-exception--button%402x.png?alt=media&token=3a112fc1-7cce-4bc5-9777-593360d3859d)\\n\\n### Component dimensions and dynamic content\\nComponents that contain dynamic content, such as text or other elements that differ between each component instance, may have one dimension (width or height) that does not fall on an 8px grid. \\n\\nFor example, a button's width may vary between instances and not fall on an 8px grid:\\n\\n![Spacing](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LJyUTfgi9aZnPg370Hj%2F-LJyqX5j7dzNTY-0lUNA%2Fgrid-exception--button-width%402x.png?alt=media&token=220738cc-919c-43bc-92c5-1e1966babe34)\\n\\nOr a queue item item in which it's height may vary between instances (but width remains consistent and on the grid):\\n\\n![Spacing](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LJyUTfgi9aZnPg370Hj%2F-LJytLOIM5SaEj5giAWW%2Fgrid-exception--queue-item%402x.png?alt=media&token=3516b7e8-201e-49ef-9201-e8f9a7b4d503)\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n![Spacing Example](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LG1ws2y1S8wyJxmy3M6%2F-LG1wtyPfXNlRhnr3sLb%2Fgrid%402x.png?alt=media&token=2d126f27-e70a-4b6b-9485-cbf7acb51e64)\\n\\n![Spacing Example](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LJp3rdk0RK3RD29DeWm%2F-LJp45NSFsFsyQNzwber%2Fgrid-card-form-example%402x.png?alt=media&token=9c8079af-5746-4b4d-a95a-d5f0c5b101c2)\\n\\n![Spacing Example](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LJtX7U3iyyHjyXwOiLf%2F-LJtX9xAKcUw029sIcKi%2Fgrid-button-example%402x.png?alt=media&token=ceda18e9-cc87-4927-9d27-b881defa9a6f)\\n\\n\"","module.exports = \"# Guides\\n\\nHere are the articles in this section:\\n\\n[Buttons](Guides/buttons)\\n[Cards](Guides/cards)\\n[Colors](Guides/colors)\\n[Forms](Guides/forms)\\n[Grids And Spacing](Guides/grids-and-spacing)\\n[Icons](Guides/icons)\\n[Links](Guides/links)\\n[Principles](Guides/principles)\\n[Typography](Guides/typography)\\n\"","module.exports = \"# Icons\\n\\n<InfoCard color='orange'>\\nThis page is in progress\\n</InfoCard>\\n\"","module.exports = \"# Links\\n\\n## Overview\\nLinks are most often used for actions that may navigate a user away from the core app experience.
