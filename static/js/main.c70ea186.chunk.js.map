This means that by and large, component dimensions, spacing between components, and padding within components will be divisible by 8 pixels (and no less than 8 pixels). \\n\\nNote: There are a few notable exceptions to this rule – see below. \\n\\n## Common dimensions\\nComponent dimensions and spacing between components will generally use one of these common values (all multiples of 8):\\n\\n```\\n8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 40px, 48px, 56px, 64px, etc\\n```\\n\\n## Exceptions\\n\\n### Sub-component padding and margins\\n\\nThere are a few instances in which the sub-component elements' padding and margins will not fall on an 8px grid. \\n\\nButtons are a specific example of this in which the vertical padding of the button label does not fall on the grid – instead the label is vertically centered within the button component itself:\\n\\n![Grids](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LJyUTfgi9aZnPg370Hj%2F-LJyhLr2SrLz94trBf7O%2Fgrid-exception--button%402x.png?alt=media&token=3a112fc1-7cce-4bc5-9777-593360d3859d)\\n\\n### Component dimensions and dynamic content\\nComponents that contain dynamic content, such as text or other elements that differ between each component instance, may have one dimension (width or height) that does not fall on an 8px grid. \\n\\nFor example, a button's width may vary between instances and not fall on an 8px grid:\\n\\n![Spacing](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LJyUTfgi9aZnPg370Hj%2F-LJyqX5j7dzNTY-0lUNA%2Fgrid-exception--button-width%402x.png?alt=media&token=220738cc-919c-43bc-92c5-1e1966babe34)\\n\\nOr a queue item item in which it's height may vary between instances (but width remains consistent and on the grid):\\n\\n![Spacing](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LJyUTfgi9aZnPg370Hj%2F-LJytLOIM5SaEj5giAWW%2Fgrid-exception--queue-item%402x.png?alt=media&token=3516b7e8-201e-49ef-9201-e8f9a7b4d503)\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n![Spacing Example](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LG1ws2y1S8wyJxmy3M6%2F-LG1wtyPfXNlRhnr3sLb%2Fgrid%402x.png?alt=media&token=2d126f27-e70a-4b6b-9485-cbf7acb51e64)\\n\\n![Spacing Example](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LJp3rdk0RK3RD29DeWm%2F-LJp45NSFsFsyQNzwber%2Fgrid-card-form-example%402x.png?alt=media&token=9c8079af-5746-4b4d-a95a-d5f0c5b101c2)\\n\\n![Spacing Example](https://blobscdn.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LFNym8ScnaWKWBQFWTw%2F-LJtX7U3iyyHjyXwOiLf%2F-LJtX9xAKcUw029sIcKi%2Fgrid-button-example%402x.png?alt=media&token=ceda18e9-cc87-4927-9d27-b881defa9a6f)\\n\\n\"","module.exports = \"# Guides\\n\\nHere are the articles in this section:\\n\\n[Buttons](Guides/buttons)\\n[Cards](Guides/cards)\\n[Colors](Guides/colors)\\n[Forms](Guides/forms)\\n[Grids And Spacing](Guides/grids-and-spacing)\\n[Icons](Guides/icons)\\n[Links](Guides/links)\\n[Principles](Guides/principles)\\n[Typography](Guides/typography)\\n\"","module.exports = \"# Icons\\n\\n<InfoCard color='orange'>\\nThis page is in progress\\n</InfoCard>\\n\"","module.exports = \"# Links\\n\\n## Overview\\nLinks are most often used for actions that may navigate a user away from the core app experience.
